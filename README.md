Just a repo to learning about the cloud mostly focusing on GCP and AWS with an interest around automation, infrastucture, and data.
I'm doing this to expand my skillset outside software development.

I am hoping to work towards Certifications / Achievements:
- CLF-C01 AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner
- SAA-S02 AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate 
- Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer
